Algorithm breaking down Polish words into syllables

The Polish language is one of the most difficult languages of the world, not allowing to define algorithms that will work in all the cases. The best ones meet an accuracy of around 90%.

The goal of this project is to as much accurate script, with a supporting database for exception words.
